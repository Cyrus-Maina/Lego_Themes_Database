This analysis assesses Lego's growth based on themes released, number of parts sold, set names and consecutive years from 1949. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
On analyzing it one should be able to visualize their growth and dynamics around that.

**INSIGHTS**

We will assume number of parts produced reflect demand and supply.

1. Over the years since 1949 these themes have done well based on the number of parts released:
   Technic, Star Wars, Friends, Ninjago and Ultimate Collector Series.
   They reflect acceptance and relevance amidst customers thus their high sales.
   
2. Narrowing down to the last 10 years we note change in customer preference in theme demand.
   The most dominant are Star Wars, Technic, Friends, Ninjago and Icons.
   Star Wars is a mighty theme by itself as it has stood the test of time.
   LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO and Ultimate Collector Series have grow popular amongst customers as well.
   It's worth noting Friends is a theme released in 2012 and has risen to be a people's favorite.

3. Growth measured by number of parts released has increased consistently.
   Increase in Number of parts released may reflect popularity and goods sales.
   This is a positive indicator to investors as it reflects a healthy business.
   2021 stands out as an outllier. It's the year past COVID-19 which reflects an idea that as people were in a lockdown, they sought pass time activities and Lego was well positioned       for this.
   Its noteworthy that in the subsequent years production has decreased as people resumed their 'normal' day to day activities.
   But such a trend should help Lego come up with new marketing strategies to bank on people who have ample time.

4. We analyze the sets as well to deduct the most dominant based on number of parts released to reflect demand. Over time since 1949 the following are the most dominant:
   Millennium Falcon, Taj Mahal, Basic Building Set, World Map, Imperial Star Destroyer and Eiffel Tower.
   But opn analyzing the last 5 years, we see different results. The most dominant are:
   World Map,  Eiffel Tower, Colosseum, Titanic and AT-AT respectively. All of these except Colosseum have been good performing for a long time.
   This shows customer relevance and acceptance by new customers and may be do more marketing for Colosseum.

5. We group themes by Years released to map a growth trend. More themes over the years will show a growing customer base and healthy sales.
   This may as well be used on investors to show they will use the capital for expansion.
   Declining themes will reflect seasonality as themes loose relevance, low sales on the themes, change of startegy may be to more licensed products rather than own IP products and         cost-cutting measures.
   Years have been grouped into decades to show the underlying patterns.
   From the graph we see themes sharply increased consistently till the beginning of 2010s from then theme release rate has sharply decreased.
   Lego should investigate on the reasons.
   
  From the analysis, we can deduct Lego's sales have been decreasing in the current years with 2021 being an outlier with high sales.
